					TLIndexPathTools is a small set of classes that can greatly simplify your table and collection views. Here are some of the awesome things TLIndexPathTools does:

					* Organize data into sections with ease (now with blocks!)
					* Calculate and perform animated batch updates (inserts, moves and deletions)
					* Simplify data source and delegate methods via rich data model APIs
					* Provide a simpler alternative to Core Data NSFetchedResultsController
					* Provide base table view and collection view classes with advanced features

					0.4.3
					* #63 added modificationComparatorBlock functionality in tlindexpathcontroller
